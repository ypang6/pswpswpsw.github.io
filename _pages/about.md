At GMU, I have worked as the technical lead for a couple of GIS, search engine, machine learning, and high performance computing projects funded by NASA, NSF, and Microsoft. The [MUDROD](https://github.com/Yongyao/mudrod) Earth data search engine, in which I served as the lead developer pioneers using machine learning to improve data discovery in the Earth science domain, which is being evaluated at NASA to be integrated into the operational system. Recently, the source code has been contributed to Apache Software Foundation as part of the Science Data Analytics Platform project ([SDAP](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/sdap.html)).
